## Description
The Invisible Cloak Project is an exciting experiment in the realm of computer vision using Python and OpenCV. This project allows you to create a real-life "invisible cloak" effect, similar to what you might have seen in science fiction or fantasy movies. By leveraging the power of computer vision, you can make objects covered in a specific color appear transparent, effectively creating the illusion of invisibility.

- **Customizable Color**: Easily change the color of the cloak to match your preference or the background.
- **Simple Interface**: The project provides a user-friendly interface with minimal setup required.
- **Video Demonstration**: A video demonstration is included to showcase the project in action.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/umairrrkhan/invisible-cloak.git
   ```
   
2) Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd invisible-cloak
```

Install the required Python libraries.
